    <p>
        A cobbler is a deep-dish fruit dessert featuring a sweetened 
        fruit filling topped with a biscuit-like dough,
        which can cover the entire dish or be dropped by
        the spoonful, resembling a cobblestone street. 
        It offers a fruit-and-pastry combination similar to pie but
        with less effort. For peach cobbler, peaches 
        (fresh, frozen, or canned) are mixed with sugar, spices,
        lemon juice, and cornstarch, then topped with the biscuit dough 
        and sprinkled with a cinnamon-sugar mixture.
